This is a patch to vim that Mike Gevaert sent me via email when I expressed
interest in subprocess management in vim. I am now sharing it so that
potentially it can be hammered into shape and be used to implement subprocess
management in vim.

Subprocess management can be used for:

* background compilation (hit compile and keep working)
* integrated debugging (like emacs' GUD)
* running terminals and other programs without blocking or exiting vim
